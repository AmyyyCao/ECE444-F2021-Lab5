Activity 6:
Compared to the old UI, the new styled UI is much more usable. The section to search for courses is much more clear with the drop-down menus and search box on different lines. The courses generated in the results page is also well divided and easy to follow. The most improved feature is that the search option is still available even after the results have been generated, this way, the user won't need to go back and forth.
